# Josu's Guide to Flutter

### What is Flutter?

Flutter is a free and open-source mobile UI framework created by Google and released in May 2017. In a few words, it allows you to create applications with only one codebase. This means that you can use one programming language and one codebase to many devices.

To develop with Flutter, you will use a programming language called Dart. The language was created by Google in October 2011, but it has improved a lot over these past years.

### Dart Programming Language
The purpose of Dart programming is to create a frontend user interfaces for the web and mobile apps. It is under active development, compiled to native machine code for building mobile apps, inspired by other programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, C#, and is Strongly Typed. Since Dart is a compiled language so you cannot execute your code directly; instead, the compiler parses it and transfer it into machine code.

It supports most of the common concepts of programming languages like classes, interfaces, functions, unlike other programming languages. Dart language does not support arrays directly. It supports collection, which is used to replicate the data structure such as arrays, generics, and optional typing.
